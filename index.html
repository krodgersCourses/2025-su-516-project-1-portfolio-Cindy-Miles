      <h2> About Me:</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Cindy Miles, a lifelong resident of north central Idaho and a high school math teacher at Timberline High School in Weippe.
         I'm thrilled to be working on my computer science endorsement and look forward to sharing this field with my students.
         Outside of the classroom, you can often find me playing the piano or fiddle, lost in a good book, or enjoying the beautiful hiking trails our region has to offer. 
         My husband and I will be celebrating 36 years of marriage this summer, 
         and we're the parents of 5 children and grandparents to 2 wonderful grandchildren.
         Our 4 adult children live in nearby Lewiston, and our energetic 12-year-old daughter keeps things lively at home.
