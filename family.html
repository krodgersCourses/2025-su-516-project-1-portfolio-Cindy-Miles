    <p>My husband of 36 years, Russel, and I live on the former dairy farm near Weippe that his family has owned since 1949.<br>
    My husband's family homesteaded on the Weippe Prairie, so our children are fifth generation "Weippers." <br>
    We have 2 sons and 3 daughters, ages 12-32. We also have a 2-year-old grandson and a 1-year-old granddaughter.<br>
    All 4 of our adult children live in Lewiston, Idaho, which is only 70 miles from where we live, so we get to see them often. <br>
    Here are photos of our family: </p>
